# Studio Web/Mobile 2019
This content of this repository was developed for students of [Digital Ideation](https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-information-technology/degree-programs/bachelor/digital-ideation/) taking the Studio Web/Mobile 2019 course. The intention is that we go through this material together, so it has not been designed for remote learning. If you are not one of my students, but still find it helpful, feel free to use anything in here.
